                I began programming at 16. Studied 2 years of computer
                engineering and completed two bootcamps. I changed my major to
                study Computer Science at Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba,
                building a solid foundation in software development.
              </p>

                I'm passionate about problem solving, agile practices and
                believe in the importance of empathy and understanding customer
                needs. Outside coding, I keep balanced with fitness, reading,
                and guitar playing. As a lifelong learner, I like taking every
                opportunity to make a positive impact in tech.
