                I began programming at 16, intertwined with hardware engineering
                work and a fascination for databases and algorithms. This drove
                my love for mathematics and pushed me to study Computer Science
                at Universidad Nacional de CÃ³rdoba, building a solid foundation
                in software development. I'm passionate about agile practices
                and believe in the importance of empathy and understanding
                customer needs. Outside coding, I keep balanced with fitness,
                reading, and guitar playing. As a lifelong learner, I eagerly
                embrace every opportunity to make a positive impact in tech.
